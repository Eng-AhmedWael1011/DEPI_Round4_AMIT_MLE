# First problem, 

# Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
# Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"

# second problem,

# Create a function which answers the question "Are you playing banjo?".
# If your name starts with the letter "R" or lower case "r", you are playing banjo!

# The function takes a name as its only argument, and returns one of the following strings:

def are_you_playing_banjo(name):
    if name[0].lower() == 'r':
        return f"{name} plays banjo"
    else:
        return f"{name} does not play banjo"



# third problem,

# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

# You can return the answer in any order. 



def twoSum(nums, target):
    seen = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in seen:
            return [seen[complement], i]
        seen[num] = i
